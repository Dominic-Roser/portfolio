        <p>My name is Dominic Roser, I am an experienced and passionate Software Engineer, UX Designer, Game Developer, 
          and Data Analyst. I've worked as a web developer at WAGIN from 2020 to 2022, and as a Intelligent Grid Solutions
          intern at TRC Companies focusing on machine learning model development and testing in 2024.</p>
          <p>I'm currently attending the University of Washington in the Paul G Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering.
            I'm a graduating junior for a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, with capstones in Videogame Development and 
            Human AI Interaction. 
          </p>
          <p>I've attended and won two hackathons: Immerse the Bay 2024 @ Stanford University for Best of Artistic XR and Reality Hack 2025 @ Massachussetts
          Institute of Technology for Best Use of STYLY.</p>

                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/gis/gis.png" alt="GIS Visualization" style="width: 45%; height: auto;">
                </div>
                <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> QGIS, Python, Raster Data, SQL</p>
                <p>The research question that I decided to investigate was in which regions should the DNR focus their 
                    efforts of forest health. I decided to move forward with this research question because with the 
                    progression of systematic climate change, it is often overlooked how this very expansive change in world 
                    climate can have specific changes on more local regions. Within Washington state specifically, 
                    there has been a general uptick in wildfires, which is due to several reasons, but is one of 
                    the issues that the Washington State Department of Natural Resources must deal with as a result. 
                    One of the ways that this is dealt with is through forest restorations, and the WADNR has a 20-year 
                    plan for when and where they will direct their resources for forest health, and for what purposes they 
                    are using their resources in that area. Fortunately, they have used and released their GIS information for these plans.
                    </p>
                    <p>To investigate this research question, I decided to look at as much data as I could relating to forest 
                    health and wildfires, then individually analyze each dataset in QGIS for content, and eventually 
                    filtering down until I found the datasets that best answered the question. The datasets that I ended up 
                    with were the 20-year forest health plan, WA wildfire history, and completed forest health treatments. 
                    Then Utilizing these datasets, I experimented with multiple different spatial analyses, and eventually I 
                    decided that to make the data relevant, I would have to query the wildfire data to get the wildfires that
                     are recent and relevant. Then I decided to create an intersection with the plan and the wildfires to 
                     display which regions are “covered” within the plan. Naturally the 20-year forest health plan covers 
                     more than just wildfires, so being able to find which parts of the plan did cover wildfires was 
                     meaningful. One of the other pieces of data that I considered but ended up omitting was the national 
                     forests, due to licensing and accessibility issues, and because not every forest in Washington is a 
                     national forest, and the DNR oversees more than just forests. </p>
                    
                    <p>The results that I found were quite interesting. I found that the locations that have been previously 
                        treated are quite sparse, and the locations that are contained within the 20-year plan are very 
                        expansive compared to what has already been done. I also found that there is a only a small portion 
                        of regions that have been scorched by wildfires that is covered by the 20 year plan. While it is 
                        understandable that artificially seeding the entirety of these areas is not necessarily the best 
                        idea, and that having natural regrowth would be beneficial for the native ecologies, a vast majority 
                        of the recent wildfires that occurred are not within the scope of the 20-year plan or within what has
                         been treated recently. To prevent erosion, flood risks, and damage or full loss to the local 
                         ecosystem, there should be safeguards in these locations to prevent any of the continued negative 
                         effects of the wildfires. As can be seen on the visualization there is a dominant red color scheme 
                         representing the wildfires, and a smaller green section representing what will be covered in the 
                         20-year plan, and an even smaller blue regions representing what has already been treated. 
                         Describing that the answer to the research question, the locations with red are in the highest need 
                         of resources from the DNR, and the regions with red that are partially covered in green are decently
                          covered.</p>

                    Issues Network. WAGIN is a grassroots student led organization that is dedicated to bringing students
                    from around the world together to discuss issues of global importance. We are dedicated to the United Nations
                    sustainable development goals, and to raising underrepresented student voices where they should be heard. </p>
                    
                    <p>As a
                    conference organizer I was entrusted with ensuring that the student volunteers and flow of planning the conference
                    operated smoothly, and to ensure that the students and speakers at the confernece were comfortable and everything
                    moved to schedule. As lead web developer, I was responsible for organizing the other developers of the website and 
                    making sure each of the pages work together and the flow of user interaction is straightforward, as well as 
                    working on the website myself and fixing any issues that were present. </p>
